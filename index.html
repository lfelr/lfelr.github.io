  <h3>Fact's about Dogs</h3>
  <p>Dogs can See in color: It is a common myth that dogs can only see in black and white. They only have two cones in their eyes to detect colours, whereas humans have three. That means dogs see colours on a blue and yellow scale but cannot distinguish between red and green. On the other hand, they have better night vision than humans. Their eyes take in information 25% faster than us, making them specially talented at catching a ball or frisbee.</p>
  <p id="foo">Their sense of Smell is really Powerful: We know dogs have a powerful sense of smell and while we can just about smell a spoonful of sugar in a cup of tea, our canine friends are capable of smelling that same spoonful in two Olympic swimming pools of water</p>
  <p id="foo2">They can Smell Disease: Research at the Schillerhohe Hospital in Germany found dogs have an incredible ability to recognize the smell of a range of organic compounds showing the human body isnâ€™t working as it should. That means your dog can actually diagnose your cancer, something scientists are eager to explore further, as well as diabetes and the early signs of an epileptic seizure. </p>
